/*
Naming packages

place of doing or concept

- language, english
- protocol, http
- net, library, kitchen


Organizing packages by prefix like tools in a workshop

- wrench 1,2,3,4 ....
- philips edge 2 3 4

what if we could find a similar system, depending on what you want to
do, but variations of that with a prefix?
