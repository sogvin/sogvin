<h1>Golang getting started</h1>
<p>Are you an aspiring software developer in need of guidance?
	   then this material is for you. First you'll learn the basics of
	   programming. The goal is for you to understand some of the
	   concepts used while programming. There are plenty of examples
	   for you to learn from along the way. But let's start of by
	   setting up your computer with the minimum required tools for
	   programming.</p>
<h2>Editor, compiler and terminal</h2>
<p>EDITOR: The first thing you need is a text editor. There are plenty to
       choose from. Below are two editors I think are a good starting
       point. There are lots of others with varying complexity but
       don't start with those unless you're already familiar with
       them. The important thing is, it has to be a text editor, Not a
       word processor like Word.</p>

<li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a></li>
</ul>
<p>COMPILER: You'll be using the Go programming language. It and
		the compiler are available from <a href="https://golang.org/dl">https://golang.org/dl</a>. Follow the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">installation instructions</a> carefully and make sure it
		works.</p>
<p>TERMINAL: Once a program is written you'll want to execute
       it. Without a graphical user interface you do this in a
       terminal. The terminal is a small program which enables you to
       type in commands. When you hit the enter key, the command is
       executed. The go compiler that you installed earlier is such a
       command. If you followed the installation instructions
       thoroughly, you should already have used the terminal so I
       assume you know where to find it.</p>
