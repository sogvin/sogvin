<h1>Purpose of <code>func main()</code></h1>
<p>The purpose of <code>func main()</code> is to <b>translate
       commandline arguments to application startup state</b>. Once
       the state is prepared a specific entry function is called. More
       often than not, logging verbosity is one such state that needs
       to be configured early on.  <br> Use the builtin flag package
       to define, document and parse the arguments.</p>
<h2>Example <code>CountStars(galaxy string)</code></h2>
<p>Imagine an application that counts the stars in a named
	   galaxy. The main function should then make sure the flags are
	   correct and forward them as arguments to the function doing the
	   actual work. The name of the galaxy would be such a flag and
	   perhaps a verbosity flag for debugging purposes.</p>
<pre class="srcfile"><code class="go">func main() {
	galaxy := "milkyway"
	flag.StringVar(
		&galaxy, "galaxy",
		galaxy, "name of galaxy to count stars in",
	)
	verbose := false
	flag.BoolVar(
		&verbose, "verbose",
		verbose, "enables verbose logging",
	)
	flag.Parse()
	SetVerbose(verbose)
	CountStars(os.Stdout, galaxy)
}
</code></pre><p>Now that you know what the main function should do, let us take
	   a look at how it should be done, apart of the flag definition
	   and argument passing.<br> First, the cyclomatic complexity of
	   the main function is one. Ie. there is only one path through
	   this program.  There are however two exit points, apart from
	   the obvious one <code>flag.Parse()</code> exits if the parsed
	   flags do not match the predefined. The single pathway means
	   that testing the main function is simple. Execute this
	   application with valid flags and all lines are covered, leaving
	   all other code for unittesting.<br> Also, if you execute the
	   program you would note that second, the order of the flags are
	   sorted in the same way as the help output.</p>
<div class="sidenote" style="margin-top: -5.2cm"><div class="inner">Cyclomatic complexity should be one.</div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote" style="margin-top: -1.7cm"><div class="inner">Flag order should match output.</div>
</div>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Adhering to the &ldquo;keep it simple principle&rdquo; and only
	   doing one thing in each function, works out nicely for the main
	   function as well. One could argue that, if you moved everything
	   inside main into a start function, the flag definitions would
	   also be tested.  Think about it for a minute and figure out
	   what exactly you would be testing. If the flag package already
	   makes sure it's functions work as expected the only thing left
	   is testing which flags you have defined.  They would need to
	   be updated each time you add or remove a flag which is a sign
	   of a poor test.<br> You could potentially refactor main and
	   separate the flag definitions into smaller functions for
	   readability but you still wouldn't need to write unittests for
	   them.</p>
<p>Keep main simple, constrain it to only set global startup state
	   before calling the one function that does the actual
	   work.<br>This works great for services and simpler commands
	   that only do one thing.</p>
<h2>More advanced commands</h2>
<p>When the commands get more complex with many more options the
	   above approach has its limits. Number of arguments to
	   CountStars will grow and become hard to verify. Turn func
	   CountStars into a command. Advanced commands may also have
	   logic for combination of flags which would suggest you should
	   verify command execution with various flags. This is impossible
	   to do with the above approach while tracking coverage.</p>
