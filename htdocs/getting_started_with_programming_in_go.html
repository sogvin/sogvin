<h1>Getting started with programming in Go</h1>
<p>Programming involves reading and writing code, you do this in
       an text editor. There are plenty to choose from. Below is a
       short list of editors to choose from. The important thing is,
       <em>it has to be a text editor</em>, not a word processor like
       Word.  
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit">
GEdit
</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://atom.io/">
Atom
</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">
Notepad++
</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">
Sublime

</ul>
<p>Download the latest version from<a href="https://golang.org/dl">

</a>
. Follow the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">
installation instructions

carefully and make sure it
		works.

<h2>Styling conventions</h2>
<p>On these pages; commands are indicated with a gray background
	   with a darker left border.
</p>
<pre class="command"><code>go version</code></pre>Source code is presented in two ways; an entire files have a gray
      background with a solid border<pre class="srcfile complete"><code class="go">package main

func main() {

}
</code></pre>whereas partial code is without borders.<pre class="srcfile"><code class="go">func main() {

}
</code></pre><h2>The terminal</h2>
<p>Once a program is written you'll want to execute it. Without a
       graphical user interface you do this in a terminal. These are
       small programs which enable you to type commands and when you
       hit the enter key they are executed. The go compiler that you
       installed earlier is such a command. If you followed the
       installation instructions thoroughly, you should already have
       used the terminal so I assume you know where to find it.
